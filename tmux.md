* `Ctrl+b, |` and `Ctrl+b, -` to split vertical/horizontal.

* Scroll wheel to scroll up a pane (not down though, sadly…)
* Click+Drag to do something useless
* Shift+Click+Drag to select text (like a normal window)
* `Ctrl+b, e` to simultype in all panes on a window (`Ctrl+b, E` to turn off)
* `Ctrl+b, [` to enter browse mode (arrow keys to navigate a pane, the `v` to start yanking, `y` to complete the yank).
